# Wills-NodeCAN

A NodeJs can-utils extension from the Linux-CAN / SocketCAN project.

I'm currently building a race dash application on a Raspberry Pi for my race car, there are already other packages out there to use NodeJs to communicate with C++, but I thought why not make one myself, tailored to my current needs.
